# Busy Beagles App

Built with React Native. We developed this for the SummerHacks Hackathon

We created an activities app targeted at kids ages 5-12. Itâ€™s inspired by the fact that in quarantine, kids are the ones with the most unspent energy as they are stuck at home with little to do. We wanted to develop an app that provides them with activities to do during quarantine and even after in order to get them active and focused.


To run:
install expo:
`npm install -g expo-cli`

install the directory

`cd App/`

`expo install` This should install all dependencies, such as React Navigation

`expo start`
You can scan the QR code to test on an iOS device (this requires having the Expo app on your phone)

<em>Android and web are still in development -- please test with iOS.</em>

<em> ~ Work in progress. ~ </em>
